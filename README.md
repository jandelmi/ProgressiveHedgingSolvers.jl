`ProgressiveHedgingSolvers` includes implementations of the Progressive-hedging algorithm for two-stage stochastic recourse problems. All algorithm variants are based on the original progressive-hedging algorithm by Rockafellar and Wets. `ProgressiveHedgingSolvers` interfaces with [StochasticPrograms.jl][StochProg], and a given recourse model `sp` is solved effectively through

```julia
julia> using ProgressiveHedgingSolvers

julia> solve(sp,solver=ProgressiveHedgingSolver(:ph, IpoptSolver(print_level=0)))
Progressive Hedging Time: 0:00:06 (1315 iterations)
  Objective:  -855.8332803469432
  Î´:          9.436947935542464e-7
:Optimal

```

Note, that a QP capable `AbstractMathProgSolver` is required to solve emerging subproblems. In addition, there is a distributed variant of the algorithm: `ProgressiveHedgingSolver(:dph)`, which requires adding processes with `addprocs` prior to execution.

The algorithm has a set of parameters that can be tuned prior to execution. For a list of these parameters and their default values, use `?` in combination with the solver object. For example, `?ProgressiveHedging` gives the parameter list of the sequential progressive-hedging algorithm. For a list of all solvers and their handle names, use `?ProgressiveHedgingSolver`.

`ProgressiveHedgingSolvers.jl` includes a set of crash methods that can be used to generate the initial decision by supplying functor objects to `ProgressiveHedgingSolver`. Use `?Crash` for a list of available crashes and their usage.
